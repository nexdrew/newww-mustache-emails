# NEWWW MUSTACHE EMAILS

> A Melodrama in Film Noir style

This is a presentation I gave as a "tech deep dive" lightning talk at npm on Friday, January 29, 2016.

It's about my investigative journey through fixing a bug related to outbound emails - a bug that *should* have been simple but instead required adding tests and fixes to [3](https://github.com/npm/newww) [different](https://github.com/npm/mustache-mailer) [repos](https://github.com/npm/email-templates).

Anyway, here it is, in all its glory. Created in Keynote, exported to HTML, and pushed here.
